# Double Pendulum Simulation in JavaScript

This is a simple double pendulum simulation written in Javascript. The user can adjust a number of factors, including the velocity and the initial orientation of the pendulums. Check it out here: https://qayyumayaan.github.io/DoublePendulumSimulation/

The goal of this project was to allow for a sandbox to test and demonstrate chaos. The principle of chaos illustrates that despite the fact that this simulation is entirely deterministic, small deviations in angle and initial position can lead to completely different results.
